STEP-1 .Examine sender's email address for spoofing.
From: Microsoft Account Team <security-alert@m1crosoft-support.com>
1.Lookalike Domain
  m1crosoft-support.com
  This is not a legitimate Microsoft domain.
  Uses ‚Äú1‚Äù instead of ‚Äúi‚Äù ‚Äì a trick called typosquatting.

2.Mismatch with Brand
 Official Microsoft emails typically come from:
 @microsoft.com
 @account.microsoft.com
 This fake domain tries to look similar to gain your trust.



STEP-2 Check Email Headers
EMAIL HEADER  - Return-Path: <reply@fake-ms-login.ru>
                Received: from unknownhost.ru (185.221.123.45) by mail.fakeprovider.com
                with SMTP id 123ABC456DEF; Mon, 04 Aug 2025 08:22:47 +0530
               Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
                 spf=fail (google.com: domain of fake-ms-login.ru does not designate 185.221.123.45 as permitted sender) smtp.mailfrom=fake-ms-login.ru;
                 dkim=fail header.d=fake-ms-login.ru;
                 dmarc=fail (p=REJECT sp=REJECT dis=NONE) header.from=m1crosoft-support.com
              From: Microsoft Account Team <security-alert@m1crosoft-support.com>
              To: you@example.com
              Subject: Immediate Action Required: Account Suspended
              Date: Mon, 04 Aug 2025 08:22:47 +0530
              Message-ID: <20250804025247.fake@unknownhost.ru>
              MIME-Version: 1.0
              Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
ANALYZING THE HEADER
Header Field	What It Tells You
Return-Path:	Not from Microsoft ‚Äì it‚Äôs from fake-ms-login.ru
Received:   	Came from unknownhost.ru (185.221.x.x IP), not Microsoft servers
spf=fail	    SPF check failed ‚Äì sender is not authorized to use the domain
dkim=fail	    DKIM failed ‚Äì the digital signature is invalid
dmarc=fail	  DMARC failed ‚Äì fails both SPF & DKIM, domain not enforcing protection
From:	        Appears as Microsoft, but actually m1crosoft-support.com (a spoofed domain)



STEP-3  Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
Please click the link below to verify your identity:
 [Verify Now](http://m1crosoft-verification-center.net/login)
ANALYZING THE LINK:
This is not a real Microsoft domain. It‚Äôs a lookalike using:
m1crosoft with a number 1 instead of an i
A non-secure HTTP link
A phishing domain designed to collect login info

ANALYZING THE ATTACHMENT
Attachment: verify_account.html
.html files in phishing emails usually:
Open a fake login page
Send your credentials to an attacker
NEVER open this kind of file from unknown sources.



STEP-4 Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
from the Malicious Email:
"We've noticed suspicious login attempts on your Microsoft account. For your security, we have temporarily suspended access."
"If we do not receive verification within 24 hours, your account will be permanently locked."

        Clue	                      Why It‚Äôs Suspicious
->Urgency / Short Deadline	    ‚ÄúWithin 24 hours‚Äù forces you to act without thinking
->Account Threat	              ‚ÄúTemporarily suspended‚Äù ‚Üí triggers fear
->Fear of Permanent Loss	      ‚ÄúWill be permanently locked‚Äù is a scare tactic
->Emotionally Pressuring	      Mix of fear + urgency = classic phishing strategy

 Legit Companies Typically:
*Never threaten you with immediate suspension
*Allow flexible timeframes
*Use calm, neutral language
*Personalize their messages (not ‚ÄúDear User‚Äù)



STEP-5 Check for Mismatched URLs
From the Malicious Email:
[Verify Now](http://m1crosoft-verification-center.net/login)

       Check	                       Suspicious?
Visible Text	                ‚ÄúVerify Now‚Äù ‚Äî looks generic ‚úÖ
Actual Link (hover)	          http://m1crosoft-verification-center.net/login ‚ùå
Mismatch with Brand	          Domain should be microsoft.com ‚ùå
Misspelling / Typo            Domain	m1crosoft uses number "1" instead of "i" ‚ùå
Insecure Protocol            	Link uses http:// (not https://) ‚ùå



STEP-6 Check for Spelling or Grammar Errors
Generic greeting	        ‚ÄúDear User‚Äù ‚Üí No personalization ‚ùå
Unnatural phrasing	      ‚ÄúWe have temporarily suspended access‚Äù sounds vague ‚ùå
Tone inconsistency	      Mix of formal tone and aggressive warning ‚ùå
